        <h1>Learn more about feeding Alachua County</h1>

        <p>Did you know that one in four Alachua County children and one in five adults lives at or below the poverty line, according to data recently released by the U.S. Census Bureau.?
          Food insecurity is a lack of consistent access to food. This means that families around you are in need of your help! Few people know that food pantries not only serve the homeless, but also serve these families as well.
<br><br>
          On average, restaurants throw out 85% of unused food, which contributes to food waste and not only hurts the environment, but hurts those in need as well. With the help of Give a Plate, we hope to give you an easy way to give back to food banks near you, and help feed your community.
<br><br>
          The following map shows the estimated number of food insecure individuals in each Florida county. As you can see many counties around Florida near your help, and in the future we plan to expand to new counties.
